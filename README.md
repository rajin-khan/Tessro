## 🎥 What is Tessro?

**Tessro** is a blazing-fast real-time synchronized video playback platform that just got even better. Whether you're across the world or across the room, Tessro brings friends and teams together with seamless, **fully private video sessions**.

🚀 You can now choose between two modes:

- 🌀 **Sync Mode** — Everyone picks the same local video file, and Tessro syncs playback across devices.
- 📡 **Stream Mode** — The host selects a file, and others watch the host’s stream in real-time, thanks to **WebRTC**.

**All with:**
- ❌ No uploads  
- 🔐 No accounts  
- 👀 No tracking  
- 🔄 Real-time sync  
- 💬 Live chat

## 🧐 How It Works

1. 🔧 **Create Session** — As a host, generate a session and choose a file.
2. 🔑 **Invite Others** — Friends join with your session ID and password.
3. 🌀 **Pick Your Mode** — Sync files or just let the host stream.
4. ⏯️ **Watch Together** — Tessro handles syncing, controls, and chat!

---

## 🔒 Privacy First

Tessro:
- Stores **no user data**
- Uses **no uploads**
- Supports **end-to-end WebRTC streaming**
- Has **no trackers, ads, or analytics**

Coming soon: self-hosted TURN fallback for even better firewall/NAT support (currently using free 24h servers on Twilio).
