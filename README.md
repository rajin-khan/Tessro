## 🎥 What is Tessro?

**Tessro** is a blazing-fast real-time synchronized video playback platform that just got even better. Whether you're across the world or across the room, Tessro brings friends and teams together with seamless, **fully private video sessions**.

**All with:**
- ❌ No uploads  
- 🔐 No accounts  
- 👀 No tracking
